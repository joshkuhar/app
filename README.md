VALUE CALCULATOR	
====================

Overview	
---------------------
This is a single page app that estimates the future value of money. The values are only estimates and are displayed to encourage the user to think about their spending habits in a more, fiscally responsible way.


API
---------------------

This version currently uses four endpoints.


### Create/Post
The user enters an item they recently purchased and the price they paid for it. They click submit and the item is added to a list with the amount of money they would have in the future if they hadn't purchased the item.

They can also save the list and return to it later.


### Read/Get
The user can enter the name of saved list and retrieve it for editing.

### Update/Put
The user can remove entire lines and add new items to the list.

### Delete
The user can remove the entire list by clicking the delete button.
